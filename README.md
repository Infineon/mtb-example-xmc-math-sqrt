## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.


## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details open><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details open><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[MATH SQRT](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-xmc-math-sqrt)" application with the desired name "MATHSqrt" configured for the *KIT_XMC14_BOOT_001* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC14_BOOT_001 --app-id mtb-example-xmc-math-sqrt --user-app-name MATHSqrt --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details open><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

**Note:** Only VS Code is supported.

1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

</details>

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using a micro-USB cable through the debug USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the JLink CDC COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software:

   1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (JLink)**.

4. After the device is programmed, the square root CORDIC operation is performed, and the result is displayed on the serial terminal.

   **Figure 1. Serial terminal log**

   ![](images/serial_terminal_log.jpg)

5. Change the value of the `INPUT_NUM` macro to try another number as the input.

6. Rebuild the code example, and then program the device. The CORDIC operation is repeated on the new number and the result is shown on the serial terminal.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (JLink)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

In this code example, the CORDIC block of the XMC&trade; MCU is used to perform the square root operation on an input number. The results are calculated using the square root CORDIC processor API and checked with the result obtained from the software-implemented API (from *math.h*). The final outputs are displayed on the terminal.

Because the CORDIC processor doesn't support a floating-point unit, the operations take place on 'Q' format numbers in this processor. The X and Y data input for the CORDIC processor can be sent directly in 'Qm.n' format. 'Q' is a binary fixed-point number format, where the number of fractional bits (indicated by 'n') and the number of integer bits (indicated by 'm') are specified. Therefore, the input number should be converted to 'Q' format. In this code example, `0.25F` is the input number.

- **Stage 1:** Converts `0.25F` to 'Q31' format, which is then sent as an argument to the CORDIC processor implementation function. The result is then converted back to a float number and displayed on the UART terminal.

- **Stage 2:** Uses the result obtained using the `sqrtf()` function (function implemented in *math.h*) to illustrate the accuracy of the result obtained from the CORDIC processor API.

The CORDIC algorithm is a useful convergence method, which performs mathematical operations through an iterative process. The main advantage of using this algorithm is the fast calculation speed compared to software, and high accuracy.


## Resources and settings

The project uses a custom *design.modus* file because the following settings were modified in the default *design.modus* file.
